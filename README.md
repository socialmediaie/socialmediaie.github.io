# [SocialMediaIE - Social Media Information Extraction](https://socialmediaie.github.io/)

This is the main website for all the information related to the [SocialMediaIE project](https://socialmediaie.github.io/). 
This project was started as part of the [PhD thesis](https://shubhanshu.com/phd_thesis/) of [Shubhanshu Mishra](http://shubhanshu.com) and many parts were done in collaboration with his advisor [Jana Diesner](http://jdiesnerlab.ischool.illinois.edu) at the [School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ischool.illinois.edu/)
